# Jeni
It is an app to help people remember when to take their medicines.

# What is it?
Jeni is a medicine reminder. Patients can create schedules and set timers to remind them about when to take their medicines.

# Setup
- First of all, you need to have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), enter the command inside the project to install its dependencies:
`pod install`

- Create a Firebase account, create a project and insert the GoogleService-Info.plist inside the project folder. If you are not familiar to Firebase, [check this out!](https://youtu.be/iMkifTEaefE?t=221)

- And you should be ready to go!
